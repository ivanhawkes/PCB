# Simple Amplifier

A simple amplifier for my bass guitar. It should use a 9v battery and be capable of amplifying 100mv up to 1000mv (line level).

It will provide three controls for tone:

* bass
* mids
* treble

Output should be suitable for input into a line level.

# Requirements

Typical Input Voltage: 150 millivolts
Maximum Input Voltage: 300 millivolts
Typical Output Voltage: 750 millivolts
Maximum Output Voltage: 1200 millivolts
Q-factor: 6
Power Supply: +9v

## Transistor

iQ (Collector Base Current): 1mA
Load resistor: 4500 ohms
hfe: 460?
R1, R2: 900 ohms

# Design Choices               

I will use the parts I have on hand. Transistor choice is BC559.
